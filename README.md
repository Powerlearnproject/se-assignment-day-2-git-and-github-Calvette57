## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system that helps manage changes to files over time.

Fundamental concept of Version Control.
1) Tracking changes:
Version control systems track changes to files allowing users to see what has been altered,added or removed over time.
This helps in maintaining a history of modifications.
2) Branching and merging:
Branches allow developers to work on separate features independently of the main codebase.
Also once the work on a branch is complete it can be merged back into the main branch.
This is useful as it helps isolate the different lines of development.
3) Backup and recovery:
Since every change is recorded version control systems provide a way to recover previous versions of files if something goes wrong or if changes need to be undone.
4) Collaboration:
Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously.
VCS helps manage and integrate changes made by different contributors and thus helps in resolving conflicts where necessary.
5) Version history:
Each change is recorded as a version or commit.
Users can review these changes and revert to earlier versions if needed.

Why Github is popular.
- Git integration: Github is built on top of a Git, a powerful and widely used Version control system.
Git allows for efficient handling of large code bases and supports complex branching and merging.
- Social coding: GitHub has a strong community aspect. Developers can share their work with others, contribute to open source projects and follow the work of other developers.
This helps in knowledge sharing and collaboration across the global developer community.
- User friendly interface: Github provides a user friendly web interface that makes it easier to visualise and manage repositories,view commit histories and navigate through codebases.
- Collaboration features: GitHub entails features like pull requests,issue tracking, project boards and integrated discussions.
This makes working in teams more organised and efficient.

How Version Control Helps maintain project integrity.
1) Change Management:
By keeping a detailed history of changes version control helps in understanding how a project ahs evolved and in pinpointing when and why issues were introduced.
2) Code review and quality.
Tools like Github's pull requests facilitate code reviews where changes are examined and discussed before they are merged.
This helps maintain high code quality and prevents errors from being introduced into the main codebase.
3) Documentation of decisions:
Commit messages and version histories provide documentation of the reasoning behind changes.
This transparency helps maintain clarity about why certain decisions were made and assists in future troubleshooting and development.
4) Recovery and Backup:
Since all changes are tracked and recorded its possible to roll back to a previous stable version if a new change causes problems thus preserving the integrity of the project.
5) Conflict resolution:
When multiple developers make changes to the same codebase version control systems help manage and resolve conflicts that arise, ensuring that changes are integrated smoothly.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?

## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
